# odin-recipes
Basic HTML project demonstration. Goal is to make a basic Recipes Webpage in the style of a blogpage. This will include common elements like Headings and subheadings, brief descriptions using the <body> and <paragraph> tags, and finally links to the recipes using html reference tags. This will be a rough website following the steps in the Odin Project task.
